This plugin allows you to create lightweight popup window in your blog with custom content and custom styling.

== Description ==

Nuno Sarmento PopUp is tiny jQuery plugin which uses browser cookies to show up a modal popup.

The cookie is set after the first time the user closes the popup, that prevents the user to see the popup every time the web page refreshes.
